# Soil Fertility Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts soil fertility based on key soil parameters such as pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter content. By leveraging a dataset containing soil test results with fertility labels, the model classifies soil samples as **fertile** or **infertile** using various machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Soil fertility is a critical factor in agriculture that directly impacts crop yield. Traditional soil testing methods can be time-consuming and expensive. This project seeks to automate fertility classification using machine learning, enabling farmers and researchers to make data-driven decisions for improving soil health and productivity.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze key soil properties that influence fertility.
- Develop a machine learning model to classify soil as fertile or infertile.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Provide insights into how specific soil nutrients affect fertility.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of soil samples with the following features:
- **pH Level**: Acidity or alkalinity of the soil.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Essential for plant growth.
- **Phosphorus (P)**: Supports root development and energy transfer.
- **Potassium (K)**: Improves plant disease resistance.
- **Organic Matter Content**: Enhances soil structure and fertility.
- **Fertility Label**: Classifies soil as **fertile** or **infertile**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
